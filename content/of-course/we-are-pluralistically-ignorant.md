Remember the [cognitive biases](https://1.course.sjmd.space/biases-on-biases-on-biases/) we covered in Module 1? Here's a new one:

> "**Pluralistic ignorance** is a situation in which a majority of group members privately reject a norm, but go along with it because they incorrectly assume that most others accept it." [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance)

Is that definition unclear? Want more context?

Here's a great write-up, with some other links (including a Dan Ariely video with a bland title we'd also recommend -- [remember him?](https://1.course.sjmd.space/biases-on-biases-on-biases/what-is-a-cognitive-bias/)):
