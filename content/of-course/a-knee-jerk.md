title: "A Knee Jerk"

"Of course" is a funny phrase. It simultaneously dismisses and acknowledges: "_Of course they said that._" Like, "We see you, but we don't want to see you."

_"Of course they support social justice dogma."_ is a knee-jerk reaction we might be tempted to make, and one that will quickly make us jerks.

We might, however, say the exact same words, to a different effect if we say them non-sarcastically -- earnestly, compassionately, invitingly.
