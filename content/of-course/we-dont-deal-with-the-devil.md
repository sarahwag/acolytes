Here's a poignant quote from Schulz's TED talk:

> "When it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes. So this is a catastrophe."

_Of course_ we don't want to find common ground with someone we see as evil.

This brings us back to Charles Eisenstein (remember him?), who, in his book [_The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know is Possible_](https://charleseisenstein.org/books/the-more-beautiful-world-our-hearts-know-is-possible/) walks us through this logic, from where most of us to a new place we might want to explore:

**What connections do you see between the Hidden Tribes study, Kathryn Schulz's TED Talk, and Eisenstein's chapter on psychopathy? How do you see these ideas relating to people supporting, enacting, and defending SJD?**
