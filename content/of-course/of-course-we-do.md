We, not they. Us, not them.

And of course we support, and have supported, social justice dogma -- we're likely still figuring out all the ways, as these concepts start to form a new lens through which we see our efforts, viewpoints, stances.

Here's something one of our fellow community members [replied](https://3.course.sjmd.space/problem-with-wokeness/people-of-sjd/) in this vein:

> "When I'm in sync with the goals of a movement and the means to achieve them, dogmas come in handy to ease the path. It avoids discussion and arguments. And exactly this is at the same time a massive drawback."

> "It is usually when I am trying to prove a point and I feel that my argument is not supported enough based off of what I have stated.  I think it felt right at the time because it was something that has support of a lot of members working in social justice."

_Of course_ we'll fall back on dogma when we're challenged after making an argument we didn't realize was well-supported.
