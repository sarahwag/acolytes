Can we leave the dismissive and hang on to the acknowledgement? Yes. We just have to keep asking ourselves questions, and being willing to answer them:

1. Why does it make sense?
2. Why is it the right decision, in that moment, or in that context, or with their experiences?
3. Would we act, believe, or think any differently, if we were in their place?
4. Are they even aware of an alternative?

We might also benefit from a slight tweak in our phrasing, too...
