One of the first things many of us learn when we're introduced to social justice is a new way to think about power.

We learn how to recognize systems and systemic forces, oppression (and privilege), discrimination, and more -- all through the lens of power.

In this way, to many of us, **social justice is all about power: some people in society have it, some don't. We're charged with balancing the scales.**

So it's no surprise that social justice dogma might be all about power, too. Just a different manifestation: specifically, **what feels within our power to change, and what doesn't.**
