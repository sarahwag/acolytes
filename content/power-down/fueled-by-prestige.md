To understand this next bit, it's helpful to have an idea of what is meant by "Prestige Economy" (a phrase anthropologists throw around). This quote from [this article](https://meltingasphalt.com/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/) does a good job of hitting on the important bits:

> In prestige situations, high-status individuals bask in the limelight while low-status individuals are blithely ignored. In this case, attention (rather than information) is the key resource. Prestigious people compete for attention ("Look at me!"), and admirers oblige by "paying" attention

We can think of "prestige" as being the measure of status. Within SJD, there are a few ways we see this at work:

1. People gain prestige when they enact the dogma, amplifying the acceptable actions, attitudes, and beliefs.
2. People lose prestige when they cross the dogma (amplifying the wrong actions, attitudes, or beliefs), or question it.

Gain enough prestige, and you can make a career out of SJD, or at least that's what it seems like to the uninitiated.

Lose too much prestige and you might be excommunicated from your community, canceled, or have your world end.

Meanwhile, SJD marches forward, fueled by the flow of prestige -- whether it flows up or down.
