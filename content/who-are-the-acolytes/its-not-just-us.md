And, _of course_, it's not just us.

There are lots and lots and lots (most, by a long shot) of SJD acolytes who aren't in this course (but how great would it be if that weren't the case?).

So we're not going to navel gaze. We're going to widen the "we" to the royal "we", meaning "We, the Social Justice Movement."

If we learned anything from the pluralistic ignorance topic, maybe it's this:

**Recognizing it's not _just us_ is a necessary step to _justice_.**
