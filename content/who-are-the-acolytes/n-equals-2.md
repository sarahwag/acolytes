We also want you to talk about this with someone else. (_Of course_ we do ðŸ˜‰)

```
Talk to your accountabilibuddy about one (or many) of the dogmatic tendencies you're noticing in others, and how they show up (or showed up) for you. The goal of this conversation is to move closer to this person -- to better understand the tenency as a "we" not a "they" -- and also to recognize where you're trying to distance yourself from the person in question (ask your accountabilibuddy to point out if they think you're subconsciously doing so).
```

And whenever you find something you can't explain, or a distance you can't close, bring that to the SJMD community. We'd love to hear about it.
