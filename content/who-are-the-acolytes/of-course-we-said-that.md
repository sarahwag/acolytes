If you're having an _"Of course you said that."_ moment in response to our "We're all acolytes of SJD" comment, because you've got us pegged... well, you've got us pegged.

We'll say it, too:

_Of course_ we said that.

Where else can we go from where we've come? To us, any conversation of acolytes of SJD has to be a "we" conversation (you can exchange "acolytes" for followers, supporters, adherents, believers, defenders, etc.).

**If we start pointing fingers and creating "Them"s, we're more likely to create a new dogma (an anti-dogma dogma), or our own reactionary form of fundamentalism, than we are to find a path forward without dogma.**

And it's not just a strategic decision. It's also true.
