Throughout the rest of this Module, and whenever you're talking and thinking about SJMD outside of the course, we invite you to do a bit of anthropological research.

Your study will only have one participant, you [(n = 1)](https://www.quora.com/What-does-n-mean-in-statistics).

And the hypothesis you're looking to confirm/disprove is that **any dogmatic tendency you notice in another social justice person, likely lives somewhere inside you.**

Dig into when you were taught that, why you might believe it, and how it would make sense for you to believe, think, argue, or do that.

The stronger you notice a sense of "they" or "them" (e.g., "They really don't get..." or "Wow, they have no idea..."), the more we invite you to put yourself into this mode.
