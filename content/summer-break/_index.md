### The Acolytes
# Summer Break

**We'll release this Module starting on July 22.**

In the meantime, use this week to catch up, participate in the previous discussions (about Dot-Com-Munity, Barks Like a Dogma, and Cutting Cornerstones), or just to relax! Have a summer.

<p style="font-size: .7em; margin: 1em;">Want to work ahead? <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/11/17/letter-from-a-region-in-my-mind" target="_blank" title="Baldwin Letter from a Region of My Mind">Read this</a>, and <a href="https://hiddentribes.us/" target="_blank" title="Hidden Tribes Study">check this out</a>. Both will <em>likely</em> end up in this Module (all depends on community input, wants, needs, and responses the previous Modules â€“ so no promises).</p>
