To the social justice person who only knows SJD, an acolyte who reinforces the dogma every chance that arises, what might happen if we say:

> "What an amazing student of SJD you have been. You care about the oppressed, and ending oppression. You speak up when you're told it's the right thing to do, and otherwise you pass the mic. You embrace the paradoxes and take risks for a more just world. You know exactly what to say and what not to say. You've become fluent in a new language and internalized the acceptable actions, attitudes, and beliefs with amazing fidelity. You've learned so much."

And we mean it?
