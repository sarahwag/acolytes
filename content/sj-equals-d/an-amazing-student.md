title: "An Amazing Student"

One of our colleagues who facilitates racial justice workshops, when she has a participant who expresses a statement that is unconscious White supremacy, is known to respond:

> "What an amazing student of White supremacy you have been."

And she's not being sardonic, or even the slightest bit critical. She's sincerely praising the participant for having absorbed so acutely the messages in society that are a byproduct of the system of White supremacy. She's highlighting a strength they possess: their ability to learn.

It would be easy to respond in a million different ways when someone says something problematic, or oppressive, or harmful. You've likely seen plenty.

It's nearly impossible to sincerely respond in this way, which is what makes it so powerful when it happens.
