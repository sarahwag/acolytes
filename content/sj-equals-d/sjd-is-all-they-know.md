There are some people -- and they seem to be increasing in number -- for whom the entirety of "social justice" _is_ "social justice dogma."

Within this group, we have younger people, people who are new to social justice issues (regardless of age), and many so-called "anti-SJW" (anti-"social justice warrior") people. There's also, surely, sprinklings of other sorts of people who'd fit under this umbrella.

If we're one of the people, we simply don't know anything else: SJ = D.

And within a subgroup of this subgroup we have very vocal, very devout SJD acolytes. We are people who were taught social justice by way of the dogma, who then deeply internalized it, and we enact it whenever we have a platform (and [_of course_](/of-course) we do).
