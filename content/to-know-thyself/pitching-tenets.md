In [Barks Likes a Dogma](https://2.course.sjmd.space) we defined SJD using the following definition:

> The set of beliefs, stances, and acceptable actions laid down by the authorities within the social justice movement that we hold as incontrovertibly true

**Thing to keep in mind**: incontrovertibly true means we can't question the dogma, or its tenets, and if we do we risk being outcast, canceled, "them"-ed -- losing whatever semblance of community we had.
