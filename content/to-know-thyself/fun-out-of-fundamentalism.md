In [Cutting Cornerstones](https://cornerstones.course.sjmd.space) we spent a lot of time talking about fundamentalism, something that can show up in all movements and ideologies (and is also a good way to describe what SJD is):

> “[M]ost ‘fundamentalisms’ involve special forms of identity politics, meaning, and labeling, characterized by a quest for certainty, exclusiveness, and unambiguous boundaries, where the “Other” is the enemy demonized.”

**Thing to keep in mind**: fundamentalism fuels our knee-jerk tendencies to identify an enemy, make complex things simple, and focus on saying the right thing instead of what's right
