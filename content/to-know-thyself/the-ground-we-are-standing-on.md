If any of those recaps felt dubious to you, we suggest you revisit that Module, and jump into the related Community section to discuss them. Ask questions, take time, whatever you need.

We want to make sure we're standing on similar ground -- and able to avoid "standing our ground."

The importance of self-reflection, mindfulness, and patience (with ourselves and others) is ever-increasing throughout this course, and in this Module all of that will be tested.
