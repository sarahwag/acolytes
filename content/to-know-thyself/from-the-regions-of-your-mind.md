We've heard from a region of Baldwin's mind. Now we want to hear from yours. One last thing before we really get into this:

**With everything we've covered so far, knowing what you know now, are you thinking it's possible for us to do social justice, minus the dogma? If so, what will it require?**

(Don't worry: We won't hold you to Baldwin's standards.)
