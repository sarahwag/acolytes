Let's go back to Brené for this one:

> Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior. Shame is, "I am bad." Guilt is, "I did something bad." How many of you, if you did something that was hurtful to me, would be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?" How many of you would be willing to say that? Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.

When we're shaming people for prestige points, we don't take the time to distinguish between shame and guilt.

For many reasons, to be sure (e.g., we -- somehow -- might not know Brené's work), but here's one that's good enough: **we're not focused on creating the type of change that requires us to focus on this distinction.**
