Let's say that "winning" this game meant "we've accomplished social justice."

That's so far beyond the horizon that's it's not even on most of our minds as SJD acolytes. We don't play the Internet Shame Game to win, we play to survive.

**We play to survive the attacks of others**, to earn back the prestige points we lost in an attack.

**We play to survive within a culture that's forcing us to play**, where silence, or opting out of the game, aren't options, they're moves in the game, they're complicity.

And for some of us, the survival is literal: **we play because we believe our lives are on the line**, that we're under constant attack (by an oppressive society, or apathetic/antagonistic members within it), so we fight back in whatever ways we can.
