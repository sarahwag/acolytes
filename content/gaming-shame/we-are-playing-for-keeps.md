Everything in the game of Internet Shaming is permanent. That blog post, that Facebook status, that audio clip -- they're all frozen in time, and are in play for (at least what feels like) eternity.

And even the stuff that happened before the game started is in play. Did someone say something a few years ago? A decade ago? A lifetime ago?

If we dig it up, we can score points on that right now.
