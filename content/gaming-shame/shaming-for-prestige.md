Nowhere is prestige more on the line than in the game of internet shaming.

And we aren't calling it a game to signify it is in any way fun or frivolous (revisit our conversation [on shaming](https://1.course.sjmd.space/hail-mary/how-one-tweet-can-ruin-your-life/)).

Here, we're merely trying to call attention specifically to the game-like mechanics present in how shaming advances SJD:

**Some people score points. We do so at other people's expense. We're celebrated for doing it well, and everyone has to play.**

Some people get shamed _into_ supporting a tenet of SJD. Others are shamed _as a result_ of a tenet (for not following it, or rejecting it altogether).

Even if we're not online, we might get roped into this game by someone taking our picture at a conference, quoting us, or [secretly] recording us.
