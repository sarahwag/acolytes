We're getting into uncharted territory here, because we ultimately cannot know for sure what will lead to living social justice, and what we're doing now that might be getting in our own way.

Is it possible that shaming others, calling people out, publicly dragging our peers, and maintaining a prestige economy is necessary to achieve social justice? Maybe.

Is it possible that we might achieve social justice without confronting these ideas as problems, or symptoms we need to cure? Also maybe.

But within the rules of the SJD game, we're not even allowed to ask those questions. And when the game is rigged like that, there's a chance we're all going to lose.
