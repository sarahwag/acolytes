Between now and when you start Module 5, we invite you to start dipping your toes into "social justice, minus dogma" conversations. By this, right now, we mean the following:

```
Whenever you notice someone in your life (someone you know personally, not a stranger) enacting or enforcing what might be a tenet of SJD, talk about it with them. Ask questions, see if you two can figure out where it's coming from, whether it is or isn't dogma, and if there's a different way you could look at whatever is in question. Rely on your accountabilibuddy for practice, if that's your sort of thing.
```

Everything we've done so far is leading up to this -- from Modules 1 - 3 -- so keep as much of it in your mind as possible, be patient, and be sure to give them (and yourself) a way out.
