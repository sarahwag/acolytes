If you've recognized at least a little SJD Acolyte in yourself, like we've seen in ourselves, you might be met with a mix of emotions. Like feeling guilty or embarrassed or ashamed.

We've looked back on workshops we led, things we've written, ways we've interacted online with a new lens, and seen dogmatic or fundamentalist notes where before we only thought we were doing the "right thing."

Sometimes it's not a mix of emotions, but a simple "Oops. Wish I knew better. I won't be doing that again."

This same range is possible for anyone in our lives we notice playing the role of SJD Acolyte.
