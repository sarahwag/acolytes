When we notice ourselves doing the SJD Acolyte thing, or see others serving that role, we can focus our energy on giving ourselves a way out.

We can take a page out of Sun Tzu's book (and maybe just this one page, because we're still trying not to do [war on war on war](https://3.course.sjmd.space/war-on-war-on-war/)), and leave an outlet free. **We can point out a path where we and others can safely move forward, away from the dogma, where we won't keep attacking, and leave the battlefield behind us.**

It'll be a challenge, but if it can make sense as a principle within a literal "how-to war" book, surely we can make it make sense in our world.

What that path might look like, and how we can go about highlighting it, will be the subject of our next Module. But we'd like to hear your initial thoughts on it first:
