In the _Art of War_ (a book we bet you weren't "of course"-ing us to reference), there's a rule ([VII, rule 36](http://classics.mit.edu/Tzu/artwar.html)) that we want to end this Module talking about.

Here it is:

> When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.

One of our colleagues, when she was younger, had a funny read of this rule. If you ignore the context (it's in a book about winning wars, within a section about not being baited or tricked, etc.), you can see a certain kindness here:

"Leave an outlet free." Stop attacking. Give them a way out.
