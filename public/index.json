Or do wrong. Or be on the wrong side of history.\nAnd of course we don\u0026rsquo;t.\nSo much of social justice is, at its root, about righting wrongs, so we have an intense \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; aversion. Or \u0026ldquo;do\u0026rdquo; wrong.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s let Kathryn Schulz show us why we\u0026rsquo;re wrong about being wrong:\n   (TED: Kathryn Schulz)https://www.ted.com/talks/kathryn_schulz_on_being_wrong (You can jump to 9:55 if you want to start right at the part that\u0026rsquo;s likely to hit you the hardest)  "},{"uri":"/to-know-thyself/from-the-regions-of-your-mind/","title":"From the Regions of Your Mind","tags":[],"description":"","content":"We\u0026rsquo;ve heard from a region of Baldwin\u0026rsquo;s mind. Now we want to hear from yours. One last thing before we really get into this:\nWith everything we\u0026rsquo;ve covered so far, knowing what you know now, are you thinking it\u0026rsquo;s possible for us to do social justice, minus the dogma? If so, what will it require?\n(Don\u0026rsquo;t worry: We won\u0026rsquo;t hold you to Baldwin\u0026rsquo;s standards.)\n👇\n"},{"uri":"/of-course/we-dont-deal-with-the-devil/","title":"We Don&#39;t Deal with the Devil","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a poignant quote from Schulz\u0026rsquo;s TED talk:\n \u0026ldquo;When it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes. So this is a catastrophe.\u0026rdquo;\n Of course we don\u0026rsquo;t want to find common ground with someone we see as evil.\nThis brings us back to Charles Eisenstein (remember him?), who, in his book The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know is Possible walks us through this logic, from where most of us to a new place we might want to explore:\n   CHAPTER: Psychopathy / Charles Eisenstein  What connections do you see between the Hidden Tribes study, Kathryn Schulz\u0026rsquo;s TED Talk, and Eisenstein\u0026rsquo;s chapter on psychopathy?
